This contains work from my Dynamics of Complex Networks and Systems class. It follows the journey of analyzing networks with beginner level analysis in earlier labs and more advanced techniques in later labs. It also contains the final class project which is a collection of network analysis performed on a network of our choosing.

All lab assignments were assigned by Dr. Justin Ruths at the University of Texas at Dallas.
